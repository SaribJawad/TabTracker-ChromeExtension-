I have created "TabTracker" browser extension with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that makes it easy to save and organize links from your open tabs. With just one click, you can save links for later without any hassle. It's perfect for keeping track of websites you love or important info while browsing. 

Key Features:

Quick Link Saving: Save links from your tabs with a single click.
Easy Organization: Keep your saved links tidy and sorted for quick access.
Direct Access: Open your saved links right from the extension.
